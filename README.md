## Diana burrow waypoints:

### Burrow Waypoints:
+ Guesses burrow position based on ancestral spade particles, calculates an intercept using burrow arrow or last ancestral spade use (**Tip: Look up or down for more accuracy**)
+ Nearby burrow detection
+ Inquisitor waypoints shared through party/all chat - manageable ignore list - switch between receiving/sending from/to party/all chat
+ Warp to the waypoint you are looking at using a keybind (controls menu) - travel destinations you have not unlocked yet will be blocked in the future, re-enable them in the config file

### Command
+ **/diana**
  + help | Lists all commands
  + ignore [list, add [player], remove [player]] | View / (add / remove players from) your inquis ignore list
  + clear | Clear burrows
  + reload | Reload config values from file
  + enablewarp [name] | Enable a warp, that had previously been disabled automatically

- Config file: .minecraft\config\Diana.cfg
